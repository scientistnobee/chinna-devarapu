Welcome to my website! My name is Dr. Chinna Devarapu, and I am a researcher in the field of nanophotonics.

I have always been fascinated by science and technology, and that passion led me to pursue career in Science. I received my M.Sc. in Physics from Banaras Hindu University and my M. Tech in Applied Optics from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. While at IIT Delhi, I received a DAAD fellowship to complete my Master's thesis project at the Technical University of Berlin. During this time, I developed a confocal microscope for use in direct laser lithography.

I continued my education with a Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Exeter, where I focused on lossy photonic crystals and metamaterials for near-perfect absorption in the infrared regime. After completing my Ph.D., I joined the Nanophotonics group at the University of St Andrews as a research fellow. In 2016, I moved to Cork, Ireland, where I currently work as a researcher in the Nanophotonics Research group at Munster Technological University.

Throughout my career, I have received over $1 million  ($600,000 as a PI) in research funding. I have published 12 research articles, and hold 4 patents and 8 invention disclosure forms.

Currently, I am leading two commercialization projects that aim to bring the research outputs from our lab into the real world to solve interesting problems using light. My goal is to miniaturize bulky, expensive benchtop equipment into low-cost, handheld instruments using photonics integrated circuits.

In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with electronics, building apps, and 3D printing objects. I also like to create low-cost, open-source hardware equipment and build cool robots.
