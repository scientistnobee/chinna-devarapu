Thanks for visiting my webste. I am Dr. Chinna Devarapu.

I fell in love with Science since childhood when I started to make demos for participating in Science fairs. I am lucky to have a very supporting family, friends and particularly teachers who motivated me to puruse career in Science. 

I completed M.Sc in Physics from Banaras Hindu University (India) and M. Tech in Applied Optics from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (India).

I recieved DAAD fellowship while I was in IIT Delhi to pursue my Master's thesis project from Technical Universuty, Berlin (Germany). During my time at TU Berlin,  I built a confocal microscope for direct laser lithography set-up to fabricate and characterise polymer waveguides.

Later, I got an oppertunity to puruse Ph.D in Physics at University of Exeter (UK). During my Ph.D., I investigated on lossy photonic crystals and metamaterials to achieve near-perfect absorption in the infrared regime. 

Soon after my Ph.D., I joined as a research fellow at Nanophotonics group at University of St Andrews (UK). In 2016, I moved to Ireland. Since then, I have been working at Munster Technological University in Cork (Ireland) as a researcher in the Nanophotonics Research group. 

So far, I recieved over $1 Million in research funding (>$600k as a PI), published 12 research articles, I also have 4 patents and 8 Invention Disclosure Forms. 

Currently, I am leading two commercilisation projects to bring research outputs from our research lab into the real world to solve really cool problems using light. 

My mission is to miniaturise bulky, costly benchtop equipment into low-cost, handheld instruments using Photonics Integrated Circuits. I also play with electronics, make apps, 3D-print objects to mainly build low-cost, open source hardware equipment.
