abstract: Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a non-destructive analytical technique,
  that provides a unique fingerprint of molecules with high accuracy. It proves
  to be a reliable and practical alternative to chemical analysis, allowing
  sample identification without the use of reagents. This label-free technique
  finds applications in quality control and in-line process monitoring, however,
  like any other technique RS also presents its challenges such as expensive and
  delicate instrumentation and complex design, which often confines the
  technique to the laboratory. In order to address these challenges, a 3D
  printed Lab-On-Chip (LOC) was fabricated and assembled with four channel
  optical fibres, which will collect the Raman scattering. The performance of
  our Raman Probe on Chip is evaluated using Isopropanol alcohol (IPA) as a
  validation sample.
