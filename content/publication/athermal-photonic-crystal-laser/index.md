abstract: Energy efficient Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is the key to
  satisfying the future bandwidth requirements of datacentres. As the silicon
  photonics platform is regarded the only technology able to meet the required
  power and cost efficiency levels, the development of silicon photonics
  compatible narrow linewidth lasers is now crucial. We discuss the requirements
  for such laser systems and report the experimental demonstration of an
  external-cavity hybrid lasers consisting of a III-V Semiconductor Optical
  Amplifier and a silicon nitride Photonic Crystal (PhC) based resonant
  reflector.
