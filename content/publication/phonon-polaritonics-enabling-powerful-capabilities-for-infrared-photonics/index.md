abstract: Here, we review the progress and most recent advances in
  phonon-polaritonics, an emerging and growing field that has brought about a
  range of powerful possibilities for mid- to far-infrared (IR) light. These
  extraordinary capabilities are enabled by the resonant coupling between the
  impinging light and the vibrations of the material lattice, known as
  phonon-polaritons (PhPs). These PhPs yield a characteristic optical response
  in certain materials, occurring within an IR spectral window known as the
  reststrahlen band. In particular, these materials transition in the
  reststrahlen band from a high-refractive-index behavior, to a near-perfect
  metal behavior, to a plasmonic behavior â€“ typical of metals at optical
  frequencies. When anisotropic they may also possess unconventional photonic
  constitutive properties thought of as possible only with metamaterials. The
  recent surge in two-dimensional (2D) material research has also enabled PhP
  responses with atomically-thin materials. Such vast and extraordinary photonic
  responses can be utilized for a plethora of unusual effects for IR light.
  Examples include sub-diffraction surface wave guiding, artificial magnetism,
  exotic photonic dispersions, thermal emission enhancement, perfect absorption
  and enhanced near-field heat transfer. Finally, we discuss the tremendous
  potential impact of these IR functionalities for the advancement of IR sources
  and sensors, as well as for thermal management and THz-diagnostic imaging.
