abstract: Integrated Mach-Zehnder modulators are key components in silicon
  photonic devices, which rely on a reverse-biased p-n junction to modulate the
  optical signal via a change of the waveguide refractive index. Reducing their
  energy consumption is a crucial issue towards applications of silicon
  photonics to optical communication. In this presentation, we describe the
  design of slow light structures consisting of silicon grating waveguides,
  which have an increased group index close to the photonic band edge. Also, we
  discuss how the design of p-n junctions affects matching between the optical
  field mode and the depletion region, in order to improve the modulation
  efficiency and to reduce the energy dissipation per bit of the modulator.
