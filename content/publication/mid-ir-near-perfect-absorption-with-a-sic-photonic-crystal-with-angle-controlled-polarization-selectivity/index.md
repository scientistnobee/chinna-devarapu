abstract: We theoretically investigate mid-IR absorption enhancement with a SiC
  one-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) microstructure at the frequency regime
  of the phonon-polariton band gap, where efficient absorption is unattainable
  in the bulk material. Our study reveals an intricate relationship between
  absorption efficiency and the energy velocity of light propagation, that is
  far more complex than hitherto believed. In particular, our findings suggest
  that absorption peaks away from the photonic-crystal band edge where energy
  velocity is minimum. While efficient absorption is still associated with a
  slow-light mode, the latter is faster by at least an order of magnitude in
  comparison to the bulk material. Moreover, our calculations suggest that
  absorption becomes optimal when light gradually slow downs as it enters the
  PC. Relying on this insight, we achieved near-perfect absorption around the
  phonon-polariton mid-gap frequency with a PC with a suitably terminated end
  face. We further demonstrate that the near-perfect absorptive property can be
  tuned with the incident light angle, to be polarization insensitive or
  polarization selective. We believe our proposed non-metallic paradigm opens up
  a new route for harnessing infrared absorption with semiconductor and
  ionic-crystal materials.
