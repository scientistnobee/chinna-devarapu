abstract: Dense WDM in the datacentre will be the next frontier for datacentre
  interconnects. Current silicon based transceivers are based on a single
  spatial multiplexed Distributed Feedback laser (DFB) and external silicon
  modulators providing an effective but limited system. So far, wavelength
  division multiplexing (WDM) has seen a very slow uptake in data-centre
  interconnects due to issues in maintaining the laser output at a fixed
  wavelength in an environment in which the ambient temperature varies widely.
  We will present results on a hybrid laser that uses a silicon nitride based
  reflector. Silicon nitride has a much lower thermo-optic coefficient than
  indium phosphide or silicon and consequently the hybrid laser exhibits
  dramatically reduced sensitivity to temperature fluctuations.
