abstract: In recent years, the monolithic integration of new materials such as
  SiN, Ge and LiNbO3 on silicon (Si) has become important to the Si photonics
  community due to the possibility of combining the advantages of both material
  systems. However, efficient coupling between the two different layers is
  challenging. In this work, we present a spot size converter based on a
  two-tier taper structure to couple the optical mode adiabatically between Si
  and SiN. The fabricated devices show a coupling loss as low as 0.058
  dB  ±  0.01 dB per transition at 1525 nm. The low coupling loss between the Si
  to SiN, and vice versa, reveals that this interlayer transition occurs
  adiabatically for short taper lengths (<200 µm). The high refractive index
  contrast between the Si and SiN is overcome by matching the optical impedance.
  The proposed two-tier taper structure provides a new platform for
  optoelectronic integration and a route towards 3D photonic integrated
  circuits.
