abstract: Automated microscope slide stainers are usually very expensive and
  unless the laboratory performs heavy histological work it is difficult to
  justify buying a 2000-10000€ machine. As a result, histology and pathology
  labs around the world lose thousands of working hours for following procedures
  that could be easily automated. Herein, we propose a simple modification of an
  open-source 3D printer, the Creality Ender-3, into an automated microscope
  slide autostainer, the HistoEnder. The HistoEnder is cheap (less than 200€),
  modular, and easy to set up, with only two 3D-printed parts needed.
  Additionally, the 3D printer retains its full functionality, and it can be
  reverted back into 3D printing in less than 1 min. The g-code associated with
  the procedure is extremely simple, and can be written by anyone. The
  HistoEnder can also be used in chemistry and material science laboratories for
  automating surface modifications and dip coating.
