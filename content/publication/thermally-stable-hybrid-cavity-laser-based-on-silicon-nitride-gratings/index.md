abstract: In this paper, we show the experimental results of a thermally stable
  Si3N4 external cavity (SiN EC) laser with high power output and the lowest SiN
  EC laser threshold to our knowledge. The device consists of a 250 μm sized
  reflective semiconductor optical amplifier butt-coupled to a passive chip
  based on a series of Si3N4 Bragg gratings acting as narrow reflectors. A
  threshold of 12 mA has been achieved, with a typical side-mode suppression
  ratio of 45 dB and measured power output higher than 3 mW. Furthermore, we
  achieved a mode-hop free-lasing regime in the range of 15–62 mA and wavelength
  thermal stability up to 80°C. This solves the challenges related to cavity
  resonances’ thermal shift and shows the possibility for this device to be
  integrated in dense wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and heat-intensive
  optical interconnects technologies.
