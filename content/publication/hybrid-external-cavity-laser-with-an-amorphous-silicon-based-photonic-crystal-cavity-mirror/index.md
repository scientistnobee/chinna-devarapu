abstract: The authors present results on the performance of a hybrid external
  cavity photonic crystal laser-comprising semiconductor optical amplifier, and
  a 2D photonic crystal cavity fabricated in low-temperature amorphous silicon.
  The authors demonstrate that lithographic control over amorphous silicon
  photonic crystal cavity-resonant wavelengths is possible, and that single-mode
  lasing at optical telecommunications wavelengths is possible on an amorphous
  silicon platform.
