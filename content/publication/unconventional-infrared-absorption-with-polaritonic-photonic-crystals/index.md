abstract: Here we propose an alternative recipe to harness absorption within the
  restrahlen regime. In this talk, we discuss a novel route that allows
  construction of a reflectionless one-dimensional polaritonic photonic crystal
  (PC) leading to near-perfect coupling of the impinging light to get absorbed.
