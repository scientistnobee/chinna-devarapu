abstract: We propose an approach for broadband near-perfect absorption with
  aperiodic-polaritonic photonic crystals (PCs) operating in the phononpolariton
  gap of the constituent material. In this frequency regime the bulk polaritonic
  materials are highly reflective due to the extreme permittivity values, and so
  their absorption capabilities are limited. However, we are able to achieve
  absorptance of more than 90%  almost across the entire phonon-polariton gap of
  SiC with a SiC-air aperiodic one-dimensional(1D)-PC with angular bandwidth
  that covers the range of realistic diffraction-limited sources. We explore two
  types of aperiodic PC schemes, one in which the thickness of the SiC layer
  increases linearly, and one in which the filling ratio increases linearly
  throughout the structure. We find that the former scheme performs better in
  terms of exhibiting smoother spectra and employing less SiC material. On the
  other hand, the second scheme performs better in terms of the required total
  structure size. We analyze the principles underpinning the broadband
  absorption merit of our proposed designs, and determine that the key
  protagonists are the properties of the entry building block and the
  adiabaticity of the aperiodic sequencing scheme. Further investigation with
  derivative lamellar sequences,–resulting by interchanging or random
  positioning of the original building blocks–, underline the crucial importance
  of the building block arrangement in an increasing order of thickness. If we
  relax the requirement of near-perfect absorption, we show that an averaged
  absorption enhancement across the SiC phonon-polariton gap of ~10 can be
  achieved with much shorter designs of the order of two free-space wavelengths.
  Our findings suggest that our aperiodic polaritonic PC route can be promising
  to design broadband electromagnetic absorbers across the spectrum.
