  We present a route to near-perfect absorption in compact photonic-crystal (PC)
  structures constructed from strongly absorbing media that are typically highly
  reflective in bulk form. Our analysis suggests that the key underlying
  mechanism in such PC superabsorbers is the existence of a PC-band-edge
  reflectionless condition. Although the latter is by default uncharacteristic
  in photonic crystals, we propose here a clear recipe on how such condition can
  be met by tuning the structural characteristics of one-dimensional lossy PC
  structures. Based on this recipe, we constructed a realizable three-layer
  SiC-BaF2-SiC PC operating within the Reststrahlen band of SiC. We demonstrate
  near-perfect absorption in this prototype of total thickness smaller than
  ùúÜ/3, where more than 90% of the impinging light is absorbed by the top
  deep-subwavelength layer of thickness ‚àºùúÜ/1100. We believe our study will
  inspire new photonic-crystal-based designs for extreme absorption harnessing
  across the electromagnetic spectrum.
