abstract: Inspired by moth eyes, nature’s most powerful antireflex, we present a
  subwavelength SiC micropyramid design, which operates in the reststrahlen band
  of SiC, namely, the spectral band of strong phonon-photon coupling in the SiC
  material. While within this band, SiC repels electromagnetic waves, we observe
  here a broad low-reflectivity window with unique attributes, with distinct
  characteristics different from typical dielectric moth-eye-like structures. To
  be specific, while the latter systems are entirely symmetric, the reflection
  response of our SiC micropyramid system can be highly asymmetric. In
  particular, the SiC micropyramid system can be near reflectionless for light
  impinging from the tip side of the micropyramids and can exhibit more than 90%
  reflection for light impinging from the base side of the micropyramids, over a
  broad wavelength range in the SiC reststrahlen band. This strongly asymmetric
  reflection response emanates from the cascaded coupling of vortexlike cavity
  modes at each of the SiC blocks comprising the micropyramids and translates
  into a strongly unidirectional absorber response. We discuss how, by virtue of
  Kirchhoff’s law, this strongly unidirectional superabsorber behavior implies a
  strongly unidirectional emission profile that is important for one-way
  infrared sources and passive-radiative-cooling systems.
