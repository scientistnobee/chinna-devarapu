abstract: We discuss how to harness absorption in polaritonic PCs, in the
  frequency regime of the phonon-polariton gap of the constituent material. In
  this regime, the bulk polaritonic material is capable of only very low
  absorption due to the very high reflection at the air-polaritonic material
  interface. In particular, we consider one-dimensional (1D) SiC-air photonic
  crystal (PC) structures and analyze the possibility of absorption enhancement
  by employing the transfer matrix method (TMM). We demonstrate that by
  carefully exploiting the influence of the energy velocity at the interface, we
  are able to achieve near-perfect absorption. We believe that our polaritonic
  PC paradigm will inspire the engineering of high performing absorbers based on
  non-metallic materials in the mid-IR frequency regime, which is of crucial
  importance for sensing applications.
