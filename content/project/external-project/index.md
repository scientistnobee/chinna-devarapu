title: Innovative Water Monitoring
summary: During this project, we equipped a small boat (buoy) with a Raman spectrometer to monitor the water quality. We focused primarily on two main research areas; i) on the development and demonstration of a real-time monitoring technology for the detection of pathogens (specifically E-Coli and Enterococci) in drinking and bathing water, as this is a water quality and monitoring priority in Ireland. ii) development of a demonstration-level integrated system for monitoring nutrients Nitrogen and Phosphorus (N&P) and calculating the assimilative capacity in watercourses `external_link`.
