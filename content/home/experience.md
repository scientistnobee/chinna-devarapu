    description: During this MSCA fellowship, I developed a low-cost, compact 96 well microtiter plate reader for applications in biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. I managed the whole project independently as a principle investigator. As part of this project, I got opportunity to work at the premises of two industrial partners: Vario-Optics Ag (Switzerland) and Pilot Photonics Ltd. These opportunities have led me to work with cross-functional teams and generate IP that has been licensed to the Industrial partner.
